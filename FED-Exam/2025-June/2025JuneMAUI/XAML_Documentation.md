# XAML Documentation for 2025JuneMAUI Exam Management Application

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for all XAML files in the .NET MAUI exam management application. The application follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural patterns with XAML serving as the declarative UI layer.

## XAML Foundation and Architecture

### Why XAML in .NET MAUI?
- **Declarative UI**: XAML provides a declarative approach to defining user interfaces, separating presentation from logic
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: MAUI XAML ensures consistent UI rendering across iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS
- **Data Binding**: Native support for two-way data binding with ViewModels following MVVM patterns
- **Designer Support**: Visual designers and hot reload capabilities for rapid development
- **Localization Ready**: Built-in support for resource-based localization and theming

## Application-Level XAML Files

### App.xaml
**Purpose**: Defines global application resources, styles, and themes that are available throughout the entire application.

**Key Components**:
- **Global Resource Dictionary**: Contains application-wide styles, colors, and templates
- **Application Theme**: Defines light/dark theme resources and color schemes
- **Global Styles**: Reusable styles for common UI elements (buttons, labels, entries)
- **Font Resources**: Application-wide font family definitions and sizing
- **Color Palette**: Centralized color definitions following Danish UI/UX standards

**Architecture Benefits**:
- Centralized styling prevents duplication across pages
- Consistent theming ensures uniform user experience
